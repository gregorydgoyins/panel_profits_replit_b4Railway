This is an exciting architecture challenge! Let me break down the approach for building a comprehensive cover image library system:

Storage Strategy
Since you mentioned Supabase in your notes, that's a great choice. I can see there's already a Supabase integration in the codebase. Supabase offers:

Object Storage (similar to S3) for the actual image files
PostgreSQL database for metadata (issue info, character appearances, storylines, etc.)
Built-in CDN for fast image delivery
Cover Prioritization Strategy
For your 6,000 classic titles from 645,000 assets, I'd suggest this priority system:

Tier 1 - Essential Covers (~6,000 covers)

First appearances of major characters
First cameo appearances
Issue #1s of major series
Major storyline beginnings (Dark Phoenix Saga, Infinity Gauntlet, etc.)
Death issues and resurrections
Major crossover events
Tier 2 - Important Covers (~15,000 covers)

Key villain debuts
Team formations
Costume changes
Major creative team runs (Miller's Daredevil, Claremont's X-Men)
Tier 3 - Era Representation (~30,000 covers)

Representative covers from each era (1000 per decade spanning Golden Age to Modern)
Cover Bot Architecture
I'd recommend building specialized bots:

Marvel API Bot - Already have this partially set up
Comic Database Scraper Bots (League of Comic Geeks, Comic Vine backup data, Grand Comics Database)
Auction Site Bots (Heritage Auctions, ComicLink for verified high-quality scans)
Cover Deduplication Service - Compare and keep highest quality version
Central Orchestrator Pattern
The orchestrator would:

Ingest: Accept covers from all bots â†’ Supabase Storage
Enrich: Add metadata (characters, creators, significance tags)
Index: Create searchable database entries
Serve: API endpoints that pages query for covers by character, storyline, era, etc.
For the Villains & Henchmen page, it would query: "Give me the cover for Joker's first appearance" and get back the cover URL + metadata.

Would you like me to start building this system? I can create a task list covering:

Setting up Supabase storage structure
Building the first cover bot (Marvel API)
Creating the metadata schema
Building the orchestrator API
Integrating with existing widgets
