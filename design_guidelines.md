# Panel Profits: Watchmen-Inspired Noir Trading Platform Design Guidelines

**Moral Complexity Trading**: Panel Profits transforms into a dystopian financial thriller where every trade carries existential weight. Drawing inspiration from Watchmen, Sin City, and The Dark Knight Returns, we create a platform for morally complex antiheroes navigating the brutal realities of wealth and power. No heroes, only flawed actors in an unforgiving market.
